**Nautilus is still under development. Use at your own risk. It's not my fault if a kraken eats your site.** ðŸ¦‘

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/)

## Utility classes

Nautilus employs a handful of utility classes to correct for bugs in WordPress
or add functionality that does not currently exist at the block level. The list
of available utility classes is subject to change as WordPress evolves.

.flex-shrink-0

This class prevents blocks placed in flex containers from shrinking. This is
particularly useful in Site Logo and Image blocks when placed inside of Row blocks.
